# C program to swap 2 different numbers

This program is written in c. It demonstrates the use of maths logic to swap two numbers from its position making the first number to be the second and the second number to be the first.


## How to use

You can simply download the file or copy the code and run it on machine. Please remember that you need to have c/c++ compiler installed on you system. 

I will try to create an executable on Windows/Linux and add it to the releases section soon.
